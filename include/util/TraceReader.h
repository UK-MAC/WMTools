 * Class to read trace files.

 * - Simple - Just get HWM
 * - Complex - Generate graphs
 * When in Simple mode we want to skip the ELF processing, Function processing and the Stack processing to make HWM reporting as fast as possible.
 * For complex we need to read all of the other tags.
 * We assume we are in simple mode unless told otherwise.
 * Complex had three optional modes:
 * - Print consumption graph
 * - Print HWM functional breakdown
 * - Print HWM live allocation data
